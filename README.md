## Sulfur Production (Lion053)

Sulfur can be obtained by building Sulfur Modules next to iron, copper, zinc or bauxit mines. 
The sulfur module requires coal as an input, increases the required workforce of the mine by 10 % and buffs the mine to produce a sulfur unit after 3 cycles.
The sulfur pit can be built in Enbesa. You will be charged with a debuff if you built too many (>5) sulfur pits per island.

⚠ Attention: This mod has *shared-pools-and-definitions*, *ObjectDummies_Serp* and *shared_Matchers_Serp* as dependencies. Please add these mods to your mod as well.

## Small Elevator Factory (Lion053)

This mod brings a small elevator factory to the game. This way modded buildings can have elevators as a construction material without being dependent on the HighLife-DLC (DLC-09). If DLC-09 is not owned / active, the building is unlocked at 5.000 investors. If DLC-09 is active, the building is unlocked as soon as the original elevator factory from DLC-09 is built (in order to not break the related quests from Donny Bader). Menu location: Right after Steam Carriages. If DLC-09 is active, the factory is inserted into the original production chain. 

⚠ Attention: This mod has [`shared-ground-textures-industry-jakob`](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno1800-shared-mods/releases) as a dependency. Please add this mod to your mod as well. LoadOrder does not matter.

## Milk from Cattle Farm (Lion053)

With this mod each cattle pasture module from the basegame cattle farm produces 1t of milk per cycle, independently of their ModuleOwner's productivity. Pasture production can be paused manually, their output is teleported into area storage. Cattle farm infotips are extended a bit to take this production into account. Unlock at 1 Artisan. Without DLC-12, this mod affects the Old and New World cattle farm, with DLC-12 active, the New World remains untouched. Compatible with 'Cattle needs to be butchered' (Kurila) and 'Pescetarians' (Jakob).
