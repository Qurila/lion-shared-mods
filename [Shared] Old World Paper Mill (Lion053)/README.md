# Old World Paper Mill (Lion053)

## Building

This mod adds a advanced paper mill which lets you produce paper in the Old World.

- The paper mill is a recipe building.
- This mod comes with two default recipes.
    - Paper from working clothes.
    - Paper from wood, cement and sulfide. Sulfide can be obtained by building sulfide modules next to iron, copper or zinc mines. This sulfur module requires coal as an input, increases the required workforce of the mine by 10 % and buffs the mine to produce a sulfur unit after 3 cycles. Tweak the output cycle with IMYA to your liking.  
- You can easily add your own recipes. A short description on "how to" is in the respective assets.xml

## Known Issues

- Decal is vanilla + 2x2 dirt decals on top to cover tracks from vanilla decal. This is to reduce the file size by 12 Mb in comparison to a custom decal. However, those 2x2 decals ^^sometimes^^ are not visible.
